### Features

- Displays hover states on all buttons
- Responsive Layout for mobile and tablet functionality

## My process

I started by looking at figma files and writing down the possible routes I can take in terms of setting up my files. I then strctured my HTML file, then i used the figma file to get the appropriate colors and sizing to set up my CSS file.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Swiper Js

### What I learned

This project was a slight challenge as it was my first time utilizing CSS grid in a project, but i got it done. I also had to chance to use [Swiper JS](https://swiperjs.com/) for the slider functionality which was really cool.

### Continued development

In the future, i would like to modify the design.

### Useful resources
